    wtforms_components exposes ModelForm but their ModelForm does not inherit
    from flask_wtf's Form, but instead WTForm's Form.
    However, in order to get CSRF protection handled by default we need to
    inherit from flask_wtf's Form. So let's just copy his class directly.
    We modified it by removing the format argument so that wtforms_component
    uses its own default which is to pass in request.form automatically.
